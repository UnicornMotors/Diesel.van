## Mexico
This third generation Ducato has been available in Mexico since November 2007, and over 30 different models are available. It is marketed as the Fiat Ducato, and as the Peugeot Manager. These models are similar to the European configurations with smaller engines, available diesel, and manual transmissions,[14] although the Canada and US version, with larger gasoline engines and automatic transmissions is made in Mexico.
